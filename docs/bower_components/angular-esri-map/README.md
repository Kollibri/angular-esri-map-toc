angular-esri-map
================

A collection of directives to help you use Esri maps and services in your Angular applications.

These directives can be used as-is if your mapping needs are simple, or as reference examples of the patterns that you can use to write your own directives that use the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. [Read more...](http://esri.github.io/angular-esri-map/#/about)

## Getting started
Here are [a few examples](http://esri.github.io/angular-esri-map/) showing how you can use this module to bring Esri maps into your own Angular applications.

### Quick Start

To use these directives in your own Angular application, first install the module as a dependency using any of the following methods.

```bash
# install via bower
bower install angular-esri-map

# OR install via npm
npm install angular-esri-map
```
Alternatively, you can clone or [download](https://github.com/Esri/angular-esri-map/releases) this repo and copy the desired module file (`angular-esri-map.js` or `angular-esri-map.min.js`) into your application.

Once you've added the module to your application, you can use the sample code below to use the map and feature layer directives. Just change the "path/to/angular-esri-map.js" to point to the location of the file in your environment and load the page in a browser.

        <script src="path/to/angular-esri-map.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            angular.module('esri-map-example', ['esri.map'])
                .controller('MapController', function ($scope) {
                    $scope.map = {
                        center: {
                            lng: -122.676207,
                            lat: 45.523452
                        },
                        zoom: 12
                    };
                });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

See the documentation for [examples](http://esri.github.io/angular-esri-map/#examples) of how to use the other directives.

### Lazy Loading of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

If your application only shows a map under certain conditions you may want to lazy load the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. You can do this by calling the `esriLoader.bootstrap()` method. See the [Deferred Map Example page](http://esri.github.io/angular-esri-map/deferred-map.html) for an example of how to do this.

## Development Instructions

Make sure you have [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and  [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-started) installed.

1. [Fork and clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. `cd` into the `angular-esri-map` folder
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
4. run `gulp` from the command line. This will run the linting and build commands and then start a local web server hosting the application under the `docs` folder
5. Modify the source files (under `src`) and test pages (under `test`). Test pages are served along with the docs site when you run the `gulp` task and are accessible from the root (i.e. `http://localhost:9002/simple-map.html`).
6. Make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to contribute your changes

## Dependencies

These directives and services require, at a minimum, Angular v1.3.0 and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript v3.11. They have been tested on every minor release of each of those libraries since then.

You will need [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-started) to do local development.
